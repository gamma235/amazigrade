# amazigrade

A Clojure library designed to help teachers with their grading

## Usage

Simply plug your values into the data.clj file and then use the functions as needed. In this example we are using predefined functions and bindings to transform the info from the data file and repackage it into a way that we can easily copy and paste into an excel file. 

If this is not clear, please read through the commentary in the data.clj and core.clj files. 


    (->> (bell-curve final-grades 0.5)
         (map #(+ (- 75 (class-average final-grades)) %))
         (map round)
         (map int))
